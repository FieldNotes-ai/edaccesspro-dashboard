# AI Development Context - README

## INSTANT SESSION STARTUP
For immediate productivity in AI development sessions:

1. **Read First**: `INSTANT_CONTEXT.md` - Zero-explanation startup guide
2. **Execute**: `./dev-tools/quick-start.sh` - Auto-environment setup
3. **Work**: Execute research cycles and monitor results
4. **Reference**: Use other context files as needed

## CONTEXT FILES
- `INSTANT_CONTEXT.md` - Main startup context (READ THIS FIRST)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current completion status and metrics
- `COMMANDS.md` - All development commands in one place
- `market_research_agent.md` - AI research system context
- `admin_dashboard.md` - Dashboard interface context
- `api_endpoints.md` - API documentation and status

## USAGE PHILOSOPHY
These files are designed to eliminate context switching and re-explanation.
Each file contains everything needed to work productively on that aspect
of the project without prior knowledge.

## MAINTENANCE
Files are auto-generated and updated by the AI context builder.
Run `./dev-tools/ai-context-builder.sh` to refresh all contexts.

## INTEGRATION
- Works with session tracking system
- Integrates with progress snapshots
- Supports quick-start restoration
- Connects to handoff guide system
