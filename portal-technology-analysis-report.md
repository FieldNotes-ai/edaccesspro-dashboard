### 2. Technology Platform Details from Program Info
From the program information, Step Up For Students uses:
- **MyScholarShop** - Primary vendor portal for purchases
- **EMA platform** - Funds management system
- **SFO → EMA/MyScholarShop** - Fund flow architecture

### 3. Comparison with Other Major Platforms
- **ClassWallet**: 11 programs across multiple states
- **Odyssey**: 8 programs across multiple states
- **Student First**: 3 programs across multiple states
- **Step Up For Students**: 3 programs (currently miscategorized)

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Fix Required
Create a new Portal Technology category: **"Step Up For Students"** or **"MyScholarShop"**

### 2. Update the Following Records
```
Record: Family Empowerment Scholarship – UA
Current: Portal Technology = "Other"
Recommended: Portal Technology = "Step Up For Students"

Record: Family Empowerment Scholarship – EO
Current: Portal Technology = "Other"
Recommended: Portal Technology = "Step Up For Students"

Record: Family Empowerment Scholarship for Educational Options (FES-EO)
Current: Portal Technology = NOT SPECIFIED
Recommended: Portal Technology = "Step Up For Students"
```

### 3. Additional Missing Portal Technology Values
The following 19 records need attention for missing or generic portal technology values:

#### Programs with "Other" Category (Need Specific Identification)
- Family Empowerment Scholarship – UA (Florida) → **Step Up For Students**
- Family Empowerment Scholarship – EO (Florida) → **Step Up For Students**
- Correspondence School Allotment Program (CSAP) (Alaska)
- Special Needs ESA (IDEA) (Montana)
- K–12 Education Credit/Subtraction (Minnesota)
- ACE Educational Savings Account (Ohio)
- Education Enrichment Program (KEEP) (Kansas)
- Texas Education Savings Account (Texas)
- EdChoice Scholarship (Ohio)

#### Programs with Missing Portal Technology (Need Research)
- Educational Improvement Tax Credit (Pennsylvania)
- Equal Opportunity for Students with Special Needs ESA Voucher (Mississippi)
- Education Scholarship Account (ESA) (Indiana)
- Accountability Act of 2013 Parent-Taxpayer Refundable Tax Credits (Alabama)
- Family Empowerment Scholarship for Educational Options (FES-EO) (Florida) → **Step Up For Students**
- Wisconsin Parental Choice Program (Wisconsin)
- Corporate Income Tax Credit Scholarship Programs (Arizona)
- Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) (DC)
- Educational Credit for Exceptional Needs Children Program (ECENC) (South Carolina)
- Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program (Florida)

## Impact Assessment

### Current State Issues
1. **Vendor Confusion**: Vendors cannot easily identify Florida's major ESA programs as using Step Up For Students technology
2. **Market Intelligence Gap**: Step Up For Students, managing 3 major programs, appears underrepresented in technology categorization
3. **Data Quality**: 46% of records have missing or generic portal technology values

### Post-Fix Benefits
1. **Accurate Market Representation**: Step Up For Students would be properly recognized as a major ESA technology platform
2. **Vendor Onboarding**: Vendors could better understand Florida's ESA landscape and prepare for Step Up For Students integration
3. **Technology Landscape Clarity**: Clear picture of ESA technology providers and their market presence

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that Step Up For Students, one of the largest ESA program administrators in the country, is currently miscategorized or missing from the Portal Technology field. This represents a significant gap in the data that should be addressed immediately to provide accurate market intelligence for vendors seeking to participate in Florida's ESA programs.

The recommended fix is straightforward: create a "Step Up For Students" portal technology category and update the three identified Florida programs accordingly.
